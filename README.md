The codes here were used to conduct my final year project entitiled "Unravelling intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity promotes breast cancer prognostic prediction and novel therapeutic targets identification"

analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data from mammary gland to guide deconvolution of breast cancer patient bulk RNA-seq data


1.	Preprocessing of TCGA data (bulk RNA-seq and Clnical data) 
2.	Single cell RNA-seq analyses using Seurat (finding clusters and DE marker)
3.	CIBERSORT preprocessing 
4.	After compute the cell fraction
