The codes here were used to conduct my final year project entitiled "Unravelling intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity promotes breast cancer prognostic prediction and novel therapeutic targets identification"

analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data from mammary gland to guide deconvolution of breast cancer patient bulk RNA-seq data

The code files were organized according to the sequential steps required to complete the project

1.	Downloading and Preprocessing of TCGA data 
(bulk RNA-seq and Clnical data) 

2.	Single cell RNA-seq analyses using Seurat 
(finding clusters and DE marker; both for low and high resolution)

3.  Deconvolution and Patient Clustering 
(preparing files for deconvolution in CIBERSORTx (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) and clustering patients based on calculated cell fractions; identifying markers for each patient cluster; conducting survival analyses for identified patient clusters)
